of the Swift Programming Language 
* For Loops
* Functions


### Prerequisites

* Python2 

### To DO

* Intermediate code generation
* Code optimisation

## Running (TO DO)

Will update.



## Example of Code it accepts

    var a = 2
    func a(c: Int,d: Int) -> Int {
    // hi
    var b = 2

    /* wh
    a */
    }
    for i in 1...2 {
    var c = 2
